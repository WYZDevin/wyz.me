# Predicting Street Crime Through Environmental Design and Human Perception

## [Link to the paper](https://doi.org/10.3390/urbansci8040247)

This project demonstrates how to:

- Extract micro built environment (MBE) features from street view imagery using deep learning
- Quantify human perceptions of urban spaces (safety, beauty, depression) at scale
- Apply machine learning models to predict crime likelihood at street intersections
- Analyze the relationship between environmental design and criminal activity

## Features

- **Deep Learning Segmentation**: 19 MBE types extracted using PSPNet trained on Cityscapes dataset
- **Perception Modeling**: 6 human perception variables (safety, beauty, liveliness, etc.) derived from Place Pulse 2.0
- **Crime Classification**: XGBoost model achieving 86% accuracy in predicting crime vs non-crime intersections
- **City-wide Analysis**: Comprehensive study of Toronto's street intersections and crime patterns
- **CPTED Integration**: Findings aligned with Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design principles

## Project Story

Traditional crime analysis relies on aggregated census data that fails to capture fine-grained environmental details around crime locations. This study addresses the gap by:

- **Micro-scale Analysis**: Moving beyond census blocks to examine specific street intersection characteristics
- **Perception Integration**: Incorporating human perceptions beyond just safety (beauty, depression, liveliness)
- **Environmental Design Focus**: Testing Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles with data

The research collected street view imagery for crime and non-crime intersections across Toronto, extracting detailed environmental features and human perception scores to understand what makes certain locations more susceptible to criminal activity.

## Key Findings

- **Environmental Factors**: Mobility-related elements (roads, vehicles, sidewalks) showed strong positive association with crime
- **Vegetation Effect**: Natural elements like vegetation significantly reduced crime likelihood
- **Perception Insights**: Beauty and depression perceptions were better predictors than traditional safety measures
- **Model Performance**: MBE variables explained crime events more effectively than perception variables alone
- **Urban Planning Impact**: Findings support targeted interventions in street design and environmental aesthetics

## Results

- **Best Classification Model**: XGBoost with all variables
  - Accuracy: 86% in five-fold cross-validation
  - Top predictors: Traffic lights, buildings, vegetation, beautiful perception
- **Statistical Significance**: All perception variables except "lively" showed significant associations with crime
- **Feature Importance**: Beautiful perception ranked highest among perception variables
- **Practical Applications**: Results inform urban planning strategies for crime prevention

## Implications

This research provides evidence-based insights for:

- **Urban Planners**: Balancing accessibility with safety in public space design
- **Policymakers**: Understanding how environmental aesthetics influence crime patterns  
- **Community Safety**: Implementing targeted interventions based on environmental risk factors
- **CPTED Practitioners**: Validating environmental design principles with large-scale data analysis

## Conclusion

The study demonstrates that street-level environmental characteristics and human perceptions are significantly associated with crime events. By integrating computer vision, machine learning, and urban theory, this framework offers a scalable approach to understanding and predicting crime patterns for safer, more sustainable urban development.

The methodology can be adapted to other cities with street view imagery coverage, providing a valuable tool for evidence-based urban planning and crime prevention strategies.
